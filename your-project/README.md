## Project Description
The objective of this project is working on a database of our chose, answering questions and finding some insights, and completing an end-to-end analysis that we will present to the audience using data visualizations. In my case, I've chosen the 'Happiness in the world' as I would like to show a topic could be interesting and induce to the reflection. 

## Questions & Hypotheses
The purpose of my study is to try to answer the following question: 'Can we measure happiness?'. During my way, I will try to answer other questions such as â€˜which are the happiest countries in the world? 
My initial hypothesis is the rich countries are not necessarily the happiest ones.

## Dataset
I've used the following sources for gathering the needed datasets:

[World Development Indicators, Data Bank](https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators#)  
[The World Happiness Report](https://www.kaggle.com/PromptCloudHQ/world-happiness-report-2019)  
[World Health Organization Suicide Database](https://www.who.int/teams/mental-health-and-substance-use/suicide-data)

## Workflow
The workflow was as follows:
 - Choosing a topic of interest
 - Finding the question we would like to answer
 - Gathering related data
 - Exploring the databases and cleaning data
 - Plotting and making visualizations
 - Preparing slides and technical paper

## Organization
In this repository you will find the Jupyter notebooks used for cleaning/wrangling data and plotting, apart from the folder with the used datasets, and some images and charts generated during the process of doing this study. 
I've also used a Trello board to organise my work during the process.
