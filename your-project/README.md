## Project Description
This project is an explanatory data analysis using the Our World in Data dataset. The dataset updates daily and offers COVID-19 data on
confirmed cases, deaths, hospitalizations, testing, and vaccinations, for the whole period of the pandemic.
My goal for this project was to find interesting ways to visualize the affects and the development of COVID-19 on the world.

## Questions & Hypotheses
- What is the overall trend of COVID-19 cases?
- Who is most heavily affected (country/region)?
- Which months have higher COVID-19 occurences?
- Can higher COVID-19 occurences and deaths be explained by other variables (such as poverty or GDP)?

## Dataset
Dataset source: https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data

This data has been collected, aggregated, and documented by Our World in Data.

## Workflow
Brainstorming topics that would be interesting and searching for datasets online. Making a rough outline of questions that could be interesting
to showcase and analyze the dataset and how it is built. Start by cleaning dataset, what columns are relevant for this analysis?
How should missing values be handled?
Start with plotting broad data and go more in depth along the process. What variables could have a relationship with the COVID-19 
occurances? Test this hypothesis.

## Organization
I used a trelloboard to keep track of my tasks.
