## Project Description
Several people died in last decades due to certain causes. This project was aimed to find out what were the causes of their deaths as well as relative finding with respect to supportive dataset of Age. Also, it was interesting to see which causes were dominant during 1990 to 2017 and their relative percentage change over 27 years.


## Questions & Hypotheses
What are the major contributors?
Other causes rather than major contributors
Was age data relevant to major contributors?
Suspicious data exploration with the help of map creation?
Comparison between High SDI & Low SDI
Relative change in causes over 27 years


## Dataset
I used a open source datasets from the website:
https://ourworldindata.org/
Two different datasets were used for this project:
Dataset 1: causes of deaths in the world
Range: 1990 - 2017

Dataset 2: causes of death by age
Range: 1990  - 2017


## Workflow
Data reading
Understanding
Finding of nan values if any & their relevancy
Data cleanin and sorting
Filtering World data so that not to misinterpret whole dataset with world values
Melting all filter datasets and saving them separately in the csv files
Transferring all filtered data to tableau to visualise the results
Making World Map to figure out special cases of conflicts and natural disasters

## Organization
Through the proejct, I used trello board to organise my work
